# squrl
URL Shortner Application

## Requirements
The requirements are gathered in this document : [docs/01_requirements/README.md](docs/01_requirements/README.md)

## Design
The design is described in this document : [docs/02_design/README.md](docs/02_design/README.md)

## Usage
This is a quick guide to how to run the programs locally from source (a more detailed guide will be available soon).

### Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine :
- Golang (1.20)
- Make
- Docker

### How to test the platform locally ? 
#### 1. Go to the root of the project.
There should be the following files: 
- `env` => configuration, used in development mode
- `redirection_400.html` => html page to be shown by the redirection server if customer or short url are not found or if they are disabled
- `redirection_500.html` => html page to be show by the redirection server if there is an unexpected internal error

#### 2. Start postgres database using Docker : 
```
	docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -p 5433:5432  postgres
```
#### 3. Connect to the database with the tool of your choice (dbeaver, pgadmin, etc.).
    - Host : *localhost*  
    - Port : *5433*
    - Database : *postgres*
    - Username : *postgres*
    - Password : *postgres*

#### 4. Run the initialization script that you can find here: 
```
<project>/db/migration/000001_init_schema.up.sql
```
#### 5. Start the Short API Server on port 8081 : 
```
	go run ./cmd/api-server/ --port 8081 --host localhost 
```
Then Short API server is now accessible on : [http://localhost:8081/docs](http://localhost:8081/docs)

#### 6. Start the Redirection server on port 8085 : 
```
    go run ./cmd/redirection-server/ --port 8085 --host localhost 
```

#### 7. Using the [http://localhost:8081/api/docs](http://localhost:8081/api/docs) or using cUrl:  
##### 6.1 Create a new customer (Admin API key is 1234).
##### 6.2 Create a new short url for the customer, by using the API key returned by the previous call.
##### 6.3 Try to access the short url generated by the previous call, you should be redirected to the long URL.

### Environment Variables

- DB_DRIVER=postgres
- DB_SOURCE=<Url of Postgres database> for example `postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5433/postgres?sslmode=disable`
- ADMIN_API_KEY=<API Key to be used by the admin> for example `1234`
- REDIRECTION_SERVER_BASE_URL=<Base URL of the redirection server> for our example `http://localhost:8085`
- REDIRECTION_404_PAGE=<Page to be shown by the redirection server if customer or short url are not found or if they are disabled>, default `redirection_404.html`
- REDIRECTION_500_PAGE=<Page to be show by the redirection server if there is an unexpected internal error>, default: redirection_500.html
