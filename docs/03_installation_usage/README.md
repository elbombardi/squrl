This is a quick guide to run the programs locally (a more detailed guide will be available soon).

# Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine :
- Golang (1.20)
- Docker

# How to test the platform locally ? 
## 1. Go to the root of the project.
There should be the following files: 
```
   env => configuration, used in development mode
   redirection_400.html => html page to be shown by the redirection server if customer or short url are not found or if they are disabled
   redirection_500.html => html page to be show by the redirection server if there is an unexpected internal error
```

## 2. Start postgres database using Docker (on a dedicated terminal window): 
```
	docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -p 5433:5432  postgres
```
Keep the terminal open, the database will be stopped and deleted when you close it.

## 3. Connect to the database with the tool of your choice (dbeaver, pgadmin, etc.).
    - Host : *localhost*  
    - Port : *5433*
    - Database : *postgres*
    - Username : *postgres*
    - Password : *postgres*

## 4. Initialize the database by running the script that you can find here: 
```
<project>/db/migration/000001_init_schema.up.sql
```
## 5. Start the Short API Server on port 8081 : 
```
	go run ./cmd/api-server/ --port 8081 --host localhost 
```
Then Short API server is now accessible on : [http://localhost:8081/api/docs](http://localhost:8081/api/docs)

## 6. Start the Redirection server on port 8085 : 
```
    go run ./cmd/redirection-server/ --port 8085 --host localhost 
```

## 7. Using the [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8081/docs) or using cUrl:  
### 6.1 Create a new customer (Admin API key is 1234).
### 6.2 Create a new short url for the customer, by using the API key returned by the previous call.
### 6.3 Try to access the short url generated by the previous call, you should be redirected to the long URL.

# Environment Variables
